# Railway-Crossings-Analysis

In this analysis I have used traditional Excel formulas and newly learned Power Query.
This dashboard provides an analysis of railway traffic in the UK, focusing on passenger trends, route popularity, ticket pricing, service performance, and delays. Key insights include:

1. Most Popular Railway Routes
- The busiest route is Manchester Piccadilly - Liverpool Lime Street with 4,628 tickets sold.
- Other high-traffic routes include London Euston - Birmingham New Street (4,209 tickets) and London King’s Cross - York (3,922 tickets).

2. Passenger Traffic Throughout the Day
- There is a clear peak in passenger numbers during morning rush hours (06:00 - 09:00) and late afternoon (16:00 - 18:00), indicating heavy commuter traffic.
- Traffic is significantly lower during the night.

3. Average Ticket Price by Route
- The most expensive route is Manchester Piccadilly - London Paddington (£114.11 GPB).
- Other routes have prices ranging between £99.56 and £104.77, suggesting pricing differences based on distance and demand.

4. Breakdown of Delay Causes
- Weather conditions are the primary cause of delays (1,372 recorded cases).
- Other common delay reasons include signal failure (970 cases), staff shortages (809 cases), and technical issues (707 cases).

5. Train Service Performance
- 86.82% of trains run on time, while 7.24% experience delays and 5.94% get canceled.
- Overall, service performance appears efficient but still impacted by delays and cancellations.

6. Revenue by Ticket Type and Class
- Standard class tickets generate the highest revenue, especially from Advance ticket purchases (£242,388 total revenue).
- First-class revenue is significantly lower, indicating fewer high-paying passengers.
- Off-peak and anytime tickets also contribute to revenue but at lower amounts.


Conclusion
This analysis highlights peak travel hours, popular routes, and service performance. While the majority of trains run on time, delays due to weather and infrastructure issues remain a concern. Revenue is heavily driven by advance ticket sales, especially in standard class, which suggests potential pricing strategies to optimize profits.
